# Cannabis Reporting Engine Adapters

API Adapters for BioTrackTHC, LeafData and METRC regulatory compliance engines written in PHP
These scripts expose a common interface for these different API interfaces.


## Examples

```php
$cre = new \OpenTHC\CRE\BioTrack\NM();
$cre->auth('u', 'p');
$res = $cre->plant()->search();
foreach ($res as $rec) {
	echo $rec['strain']['name'];
	echo "\n";
}
```
